Introduction
A current challenge in neuroscience is determining the spiking of neurons from recordings of features that are related to their firing, but which are naturally noisy and imprecise. Calcium imaging is a popular technique that optically measures intracellular levels of calcium from thousands of neurons simultaneously. Despite several advantages of calcium imaging, it suffers from the drawback that the calcium levels only provide a proxy for neuronal firing. Even though there is a strong biophysical framework to explain how neuronal firing relates to calcium currents, it is not clear how we can mathematically calculate the neuronal spiking from calcium signals due to factors like limited sampling rates and dye-buffering. A precise and fast algorithm for doing this would obviate the need for jointly calibrating the electrophysiological and imaging experiments.
Several computational models (deconvolution filters, Bayesian, biophysical and generalized linear models) have been proposed to predict the spike trains from calcium currents, but their estimation necessitates making several assumptions about the mechanism underlying the relationship between calcium currents and neuronal spiking. Here we propose a supervised machine learning approach that does not require any such assumptions. We expect that the proposed approach would outperform the state of the art methods in the precision of spike estimation, in addition to uncovering novel nuances in the relationship between calcium currents and spiking. This method may even be implemented concurrently alongside data acquisition, thus providing real time predictions of spike trains.
